I'm a software engineer in NYC building in the embedded payroll space at [<ins>**Check**</ins>](https://checkhq.com).

I recently completed my undergrad at the University of Toronto studying math, computer science and history. Previously, I've built LLM applications for e-commerce at [<ins>**OpenStore**</ins>](https://open.store) and dabbled in infrastructure  and front-end projects at **Microsoft**.

In my free time, I enjoy travelling, listening to podcasts (my favorites are [<ins>**Invest Like The Best**</ins>](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/invest-like-the-best-with-patrick-oshaughnessy/id1154105909) and [<ins>**Acquired**</ins>](https://www.acquired.fm/)), trying new foods and restaurants, running and playing basketball, watching the NFL, and chilling with my friends.  I've started posting some of my writings and hope to become more consistent moving forward.


### What I'm interested in learning about at the moment:

  * Embedded fintech
  * AI-enabled services businesses
  * Vertical software and agents
