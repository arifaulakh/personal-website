I'm a software engineer at [<ins>**Comulate**</ins>](https://comulate.com/about) building at the intersection of insurance and AI. I live in San Francisco, and am originally from Toronto.

Previously, I worked on payroll infrastructure software at [<ins>**Check**</ins>](https://checkhq.com) in NYC, built LLM applications for e-commerce at **OpenStore**, and dabbled in infrastructure and front-end projects at **Microsoft**. I studied math, computer science, and history at the University of Toronto.

In my free time, I enjoy running, travelling, listening to podcasts (my favorites are [<ins>**Invest Like The Best**</ins>](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/invest-like-the-best-with-patrick-oshaughnessy/id1154105909) and [<ins>**Acquired**</ins>](https://www.acquired.fm/)), trying new foods and restaurants, playing basketball, watching the NFL, and chilling with my friends.  I've started posting some of my writings and hope to become more consistent moving forward.


### What I'm interested in learning about at the moment:
